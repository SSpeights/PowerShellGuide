# Write what you are going to do before coding

No you don't have to do like this if you don't want to. But, scripts are in a sense just like code and it is good when other people can understand what a script is for - maybe they can use it too. Also, if you take the time to elaborate the tasks that your script should perform, i.e. if you think about if first and make a plan, you'll probably write a better script. Not only will other folks understand your script better - you will too.
