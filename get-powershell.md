# Get PowerShell

Powershell is evolving and one of the PS "adaptations" is that it is now interoperable with Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Up to version 5, Powershell was automatically installed on Windows, but the newest version is available as a binary on GitHub. That's right PS has become another Microsoft open source project. It's generally a good idea to work with the newest version of Powershell because with the newest version, you get the newest features and, generally, you don't have to worry aobut backwards compatibility.

## Download PowerShell

You can get the latest Powershel Binary here - [https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell). Be sure to click on the link the installer you want in "Downloads" - and not the link to the "Supported Platform" in the first column.
