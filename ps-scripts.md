# Scripting basics in PowerShell

Very simply, the reason why you want to learn how to crate Powershell scripts is because a script can be automated. Even if you only save 5 minutes by automating a task, if you have to perform that task 5 times a day - you still save 25 minutes. These savings add up. 

PowerShell scripts have the .ps1 extension. If you have already selected an IDE for your scripting, you can go ahead and open it. Create a .ps1 script and name it "Hello.ps1" 

in the script add - `write-output "Hello"`. 

To run the script go down to the console bash and type in .\Hello.ps1

Just like a shell script in Linux, you must type in a ".\" to run the script. In this script, we just added a command, unlike the typing in write-output at the command line you can schedule this script to run whenever and as often as you like. Here are some of the basics you need to know about scripting -

| PowerShell Script Basic Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| PS Script file extension | .ps1 |
| Run a PS script | .\&lt;ScriptName.ext&gt; |
| PS Script variable character | $ |
| PS Script escape character | \` |
| PS Script pipline character | \|  |
