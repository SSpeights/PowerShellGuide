# Scripting cmdlets

One way to look at a powershell script is to see it as a grouping of cmdlets that run sequentially. A script can be much more elaborate than just a set of commands but, like this book, a set of cmdlets is the basis for creating a powershell script

## Grab your history

If you created a get-history command list as described in chapter 5, open that up. Hopefully, you experimented long enough to create a series of commands that fit "get data \| process data \| output data" - maybe event a couple iterations of this pattern that outputs something useful for you.

## Create a .ps1 file

Create a .ps1 file

## Add cmdlets

Copy the cmdlets out of the list and paste them into your script and try running the script from the command line.
