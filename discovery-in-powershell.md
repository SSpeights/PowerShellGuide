## Getting savvy with PowerShell

PowerShell has quite a few resources that can help you get up to speed with this technology. There are many cmdlets in PowerShell so it is important to find out what they do and how you can used them. In addition, there is a large Powershell community and you can get help using the normal channels. Major outlets for PowerShell ideas are -

* [Microsoft's PowerShell Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/)
* [PowerShell Communities including StackOverflow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/#pivot=main&panel=community)
* [The Powershell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/) - Official repository for PS-Module and PS-Scripts that you can download and use
* [PowerShell Magazine](http://www.powershellmagazine.com/) \(PS-people like Keith Hill post articles here\)
