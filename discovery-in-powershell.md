## Getting savvy with PowerShell

PowerShell has quite a few resources that can help you get up to speed with this technology. There are many cmdlets in PowerShell so it is important to find out what they do and how you can used them. In addition, there is a large Powershell community and you can get help using the normal channels. Major outlets for PowerShell ideas are -

* [Microsoft's PowerShell Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/)
* [PowerShell Communities including StackOverflow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/#pivot=main&panel=community)
* [The Powershell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/) - Official repository for PS-Module and PS-Scripts that you can download and use
* [PowerShell Magazine](http://www.powershellmagazine.com/) \(PS-people like Keith Hill post articles here\)

These resources are geared toward finding more tutorials and connecting with people to get anwers to questions. But the real star of the resource-show is the PowerShell CLI itself.

### Make sure help is up to date

The easiest way to find out what you can do with PowerShell is to open the PS-console and type `get-help <ps-command>` or just `help <pscommand>.`

Before you do this though, you should be sure that you have all of the help on your machine. 

To do this, type `update-help` at the PS command prompt.

### Exemplary help

* There are generally two ways to view help in the console itself or online - you can access both types from the command line. for help, just like anything else PowerShell, I recommend that you use the console. But, if you absolutely must have a more easily readable format, or if you cannot get the entire help page onto your computer you can always go online by adding the `-online` paramemter to your `get-help` command. 

  Please also note that you when you make a help request, you can also ask for examples of a command or you can ask for the entire help page that contains all the help that there is. Some examples here are

  * in the console 
  * online

### Find-Module
