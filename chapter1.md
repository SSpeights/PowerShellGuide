# Beginning Powershell Book Layout

What are the basic tasks that our DevOps community peforms?

Some principles of DevOps

```
 Immutable Everything

 Automate Build, Deploy and Manage AMAP (As much as possible)

 Cattle Not Pets
```

These environments must have a specific configuration to run correctly. Deploying and configuring requires provisioning new images, copying file dependencies, checking if all the values are correct, installing software, testing this software and logging the results of all of this somewhere, so success can be reported or failure can be solved. Powershell can help perform and manage all of these tasks, which is why we are writing a short book.

In general, before we get into doing PowerShell, it is good to understand what is going to be in this book and how you can best get up to speed with PowerShell. PowerShell has many features that make figuring out how to do jobs easier for you, and, since this is just a starting point, this Gitbook is laid out like this -

* Which dev environments \(IDEs\) are good for working with PowerShell 
* How PowerShell is structured
* How to find your way around PowerShell
* How to pipeline
* Basic scripting, how to structure scripts and how to script \( a little \)
* A list of PowerShell resources that may be interesting for your PowerShell scripting

The book is being hosted on GitHub and so if you would like to contribute to it, feel free to fork the repository and create pull requests. We love all contributions.
