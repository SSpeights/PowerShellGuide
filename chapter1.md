These environments must have a specific configuration to run correctly. Deploying and configuring requires provisioning new images, copying file dependencies, checking if all the values are correct, installing software, testing this software and logging the results of all of this somewhere so success or failure can be reported. Powershell can help perform and manage all of these tasks, which is why we are writing something.

In general, before we get into doing PowerShell commands, it is good to understand what is going to be in this book and how you can best get up to speed with PowerShell. PowerShell has many features that make figuring out how to do stuff easier for you, and, since this is a good place to start. This Gitbook is laid out like this -

* Which dev environments are good for working with powershell \(IDEs\)
* How PowerShell is structured
* How to find your way around PowerShell
* Basic PowerShell commands that everyone needs
* How to expand basic commands to spread across multiple computers \(Without Scripting\)
* Basic scripting, how to structure scripts and configuring cron jobs
