# The Basics

What are the basic tasks that our DevOps community peforms? DevOps who write builds to deploy computing environments and applications. These environment must have a specific configuration to run correctly. Deploying and configuring requires provisioning new images, copying file dependencies, checking if all the values are correct, installing software, testing this software and logging the results of all of this somewhere so success or failure can be reported. Powershell can help perform and manage all of these tasks. 

Here we are going to take a look at cmdlets \(commandlets\) the most basic building block of Powershell.
