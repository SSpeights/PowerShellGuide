# The Basics

What are the basic tasks that our DevOps community peforms? DevOps who write builds to deploy computing environments and applications. These environment must have a specific configuration to run correctly. Deploying and configuring requires provisioning new images, copying file dependencies, checking if all the values are correct, installing software, testing this software and logging the results of all of this somewhere so success or failure can be reported. Powershell can help perform and manage all of these tasks.

In general before we get into doing PowerShell commands, it is good to understand what is going to be in this book and how you can best get up to speed with PowerShell. PowerShell has many features that make figuring out how to do stuff easier for you, and, since this is a good place to start. This Gitbook is laid out like this -

* How PowerShell is structured
* Which dev environments are good for working with powershell \(IDEs\)
* Which resources you can use to find out "what's there"
* Basic powershell commands that fit to the tasks we perform here
* How to expand basic commands to spread across multiple computers \(Without Scripting\)
* Basic scripting, how to structure scripts and configuring cron jobs
* A list of features that may be interesting for you as a member of Haufe Group
