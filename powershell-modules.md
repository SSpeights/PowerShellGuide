# PowerShell Modules

Finally, we take a look at Powershell modules. Modules are essentially PowerShell libraries where you can store functions and, by installing these modules, persist them across PowerShell Sessions. Modules can be used to store and manage functions that you write to make managing your systems easier. Even better, these modules can be shared with other people to help them operate their systems too. 

PowerShell modules are stored in files with the .psm1 extension, and the general workflow for personal-use moduels is

* Create a local PS module repository
* save related functions as a module in a .psm1 file
* import the module
* use the functions directly from the command line

## Save your functions to a module file

## Import your module in your PS-Profile

## Use functions
