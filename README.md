# Why Powershell

You may have already asked yourself. To many, Powershell may seem like an obscure command line tool that is the next generation cmd / DOS from Microsoft. Fact is though after many years of trying Microsoft has developed a powerful scripting environment and language that combines incorporates both OS scripting and advanced software programming capabilities.  You can run commands and create scripts and cron-jobs with Powershell but you can also leverage .NET framework objects and run executables with Powershell and do it all from the command line.

With PowerShell you have more options to create Administrating and Operating solutions for Windows systems with robust set of commands, pipelining and scripting these commands \(with programming language structures like looping\), Using other .NET languages and other applications to extend powershells features, while using powershell to manage these toos.

PowerShell provides better performance because it does not require a GUI. CLI management allows you to use "headless" servers that also provides higher computing performance because the overhead of a GUI is not there. PowerShell can call all of the features exposed by the Windows operating system and by the .NET framework. And, PowerShell passes data across the pipeline from one command to the next using serialized objects allowing for easier manipulation of data and enabling a more powerful feature set. This combination of CLI-capabilities that has access to so much Windows funcitonality is a powerful tool you can use for you Ops tasks.And, in the end PowerShell exposes much more functionality than the Windows management GUIs anyway, so it makes much sense to use it, because with a little work the results can be better and, just as important, reused and automated.

Here are some of the things you can do with PowerShell are:

* Retrieve dependencies
* Configure and clean systems for testing or deployment
* Check network connectivity
* Manage Azure services
* Add and manage Active Directory users
* Structure and pipeline complex tasks



I hope that it is already a little bit convincing. There are certainly alternatives to creating Powershell solutions but for Operating in a Windows DevOps ecosystem, PowerShell is perhaps the best solution. Let's take a look at it in the follwoing sections.
