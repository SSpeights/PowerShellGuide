# Why Powershell?

You may have already asked yourself. To many, Powershell \(PS\) may seem like an obscure command line tool that is the next generation cmd / DOS from Microsoft. Fact is though after many years of trying Microsoft has developed a powerful scripting environment and language that combines both OS scripting and advanced software programming capabilities.  Not only can you run commands and create scripts and autoamte them via cron-jobs with Powershell, you can also leverage the entire .NET framework, run executables with Powershell and do it all from the command line.

With PowerShell you have more options to create Administrating and Operating solutions for Windows systems with robust set of commands, pipelining and scripting options \(including programming language structures like looping, OO and so on\). You can also combine other .NET languages and other applications into PS-scripts to extend powershell features, using powershell to manage these too.

PowerShell provides better performance because it does not require a GUI. CLI management allows you to use "headless" servers that also provides higher computing performance because the overhead of a GUI is not there. PowerShell can call all of the features exposed by the Windows operating system and by the .NET framework. And, PowerShell passes data across the pipeline from one command to the next using serialized objects allowing for easier manipulation of data and enabling a more powerful feature set. This combination of CLI-capabilities that has access to so much Windows funcitonality is a powerful tool you can use for you Ops tasks.And, in the end PowerShell exposes much more functionality than the Windows management GUIs anyway, so it makes much sense to use it, because with a little work the results can be better and, just as important, reused and automated. Finally, in most cases, PowerShell works directly from the command without having to fire up compilers or interpreters to create binaries. This means it is often the fastest way to get something done.

Here are some of the things you can do with PowerShell:

* Retrieve dependencies
* Configure and clean systems for testing or deployment
* Check network connectivity
* Manage Azure services
* Add and manage Active Directory users
* Structure and pipeline complex tasks

I hope that PS already sounds a little bit convincing. There are certainly alternatives to creating Powershell solutions but for Operating in a Windows DevOps ecosystem, PowerShell is perhaps the best solution. Let's take a look at it in the follwoing sections.

Like other "Haufe Guides" this book does not profess to contain all of the information. The books purpose is to provide a good narrative and structure to help you on your PS-journey and get started with PowerShell. That being said the book itself will lean towards tasks that must be performed at Haufe Group, and, when it's done, there will be many contextually-places links that will take you to articles, tutorials, github repos and so on. These links will try to deep-link you right to the important information so you can learn what you need to know right away.
